# KNN Model

## Description
This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in Python. The KNN algorithm is a simple yet effective classification algorithm used for supervised learning tasks.

## Features
- Classification of data points based on the majority class of their k nearest neighbors.
- Customizable value of k to tune the model's performance.
- Supports both binary and multiclass classification tasks.

## Usage
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/VARUN-688/KNN-Model>
    cd KNN-Model
    ```

2. **Dependencies**: This implementation requires Python 3 and pandas library.

    You can install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

3. **Model Initialization**: Initialize the KNN model with your data.

    ```python
    from knn import KNN

    # Provide your data dictionary and value of k
    data = {...}  # Your data dictionary
    k = 5  # Value of k
    knn = KNN(dic=data, k=k)
    ```

4. **Prediction**: Predict the label for a test point.

    ```python
    test_point = (3, 3)  # Example test point
    predicted_label = knn.predict(test_point)
    print(f'The predicted label for the test point {test_point} is {predicted_label}')
    ```
